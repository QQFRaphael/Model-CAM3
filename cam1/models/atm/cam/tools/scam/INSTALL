This file documents the installation of the NCAR Single Column Atmospheric 
Model (SCAM)

Supported OS/architecture/compiler combinations
************************************************

SCAM is only supported on the Intel platform. 

Note: In the past SCAM has been ported to SUN, IBM, and HP architectures 
and can most likely be made to run on those platforms again with a few
code changes and modifications to the configure script and Makefile. 

Installing SCAM
****************

SCAM is now a part of the CAM distribution.  To run CAM in single
column mode requires a fortran compiler and all of the libraries
needed to compile CAM.  In addition you will need the QT library which
is freely available for the Linux platform from
www.trolltech.com. Most distributions of Linux already have a
version of QT installed and most likely you will be able to use the
installed code. Just make sure that the installed QT package has the
QT 'moc' and 'uic' binaries available.  (You can check this using your
distribution's package manager or by using the locate utility.
Ex. typing 'locate uic | grep bin' will list all files containing the
letters uic and residing in a bin directory.)  If you don't have QT
installed or are lacking the required QT binaries you can download and
build the QT library from trolltech.

The following instructions assume that you have downloaded the CAM tar
file, along with all of the required datasets. (See  
http://www.ccsm.ucar.edu/php/ccsmAgreement.php?indexId=4 for a link to
the CAM Source and datasets)

1.  Setup environment variables

	NCARG_ROOT (point to the root of the ncarg library)
        QTDIR  (point to the root of the QT header files, binaries, and libraries)
	PGI (point to root of pgf compiler)
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH (points to library directories for QT, NCARG)
        PATH (add bin directories for the compiler, netcdf, qt, and 
              ncarg packages to your search path) 
        CSMDATA (point to root of CAM dataset directory)

2.  Untar the CAM distribution and cd into the scam directory.

    tar xvf cam3.0.tar
    cd cam1/models/atm/cam/tools/scam

3   Untar the cam datasets.  Make sure the environment variable CSMDATA
    points to this location.

    tar xvf cam3.0_datasets.tar

4   Configure and compile the GUI and model executable by typing

    gmake

    The first time gmake is run it will begin by trying to configure both the
    SCAM GUI as well as the model executable.  If you setup the environment
    variables properly the configure scripts should find everything needed 
    to compile the model.  You should be able to choose the default values 
    for most of the configuration questions.

    If the configure works properly the SCAM GUI and model executable will
    start to compile.

5.  After a successful compile you should be ready to run SCAM: just type 
    `scam' at the command line. Please read the SCAM User's Guide 
    for detailed instructions on using SCAM, and for more detailed 
    information on installation and troubleshooting. The user's guide 
    can be read using a web browser and is located in the html subdirectory.
