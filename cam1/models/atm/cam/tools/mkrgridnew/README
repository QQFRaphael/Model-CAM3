This code interpolates data with xy data ordering in the first two
dimensions.  Thus it is suitable for history and initial files which do not
have xzy ordering.  In addition to PC-Linux, AIX, and IRIX64 architectures,
it runs on Cray X1 machines.  It also properly handles history files with
cloud simulator output.  So it can replace "mkrgrid" once xzy ordered initial
files are abandoned.

Running gnumake in this directory will create an executable named
"mkrgridnew" in the current directory.  Its function is to take an input CAM
history file and interpolate it either from a full grid to a reduced grid
(the default), or from a reduced grid to a full grid ("-r" option).  When
going full->reduced, a namelist defining the reduced grid must be specified
to be read from stdin.  An example namelist for a 1-digit grid (nl.r1up) is
contained in this directory.  When coverting reduced->full, no namelist is
needed as this information is contained in the netcdf history file.

Default interpolation is linear (-l).  Other options available are Fourier
(-f), cubic (-c), and monotonic cubic (-m field_name).  Fourier and cubic
options apply to the entire file, while monotonic cubic must be specified on
a field by field basis.

An example usage might be:

mkrgridnew h0001.nc h0001.reduced.nc < nl.r1up

then to reverse the operation:

mkrgridnew -r h0001.reduced.nc h0001.nc
